## Dataset

> Prosper is a peer-to-peer lending platform that aims to connect people who need money with those people who have the money to invest. In this data analysis project, I have explored the Prosper dataset, prepare it for analysis and used 'Pyplot and Seaborn' to create my visualization and communicate results.
